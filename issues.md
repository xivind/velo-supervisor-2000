# ISSUES CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS

This file (ISSUES.md) must be read on startup. This file contains information on what we are currently working on. Claude Code should ensure that this file is up to date, as the work progress. Always reference issue [#177](https://github.com/xivind/velo-supervisor-2000/issues/177) in the commit messages. When issues are confirmed to be resolved, move them to the bottom of the file in a separate section, and reformulate them to a short one sentence description, to keep a log of whats have been resolved.
