# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT**: Claude Code must ALWAYS read this repository-level CLAUDE.md file at startup. The CLAUDE.md file describes the application Velo Supervisor 2000, application architecture, design principles, learning points, and other key information that must be consulted when working on the application.Additionally, the ISSUES.md file must be read on startup. The ISSUES.md file contains information on what we are currently working on. Claude Code should ensure that the ISSUES.md file is up to date, as the work progress. Furthermore, on startup, Claude Code should state what we are working on and ask what parts we should focus on.

REMEMBER: ONLY ONE ISSUE AT THE TIME IN ISSUES.MD. Full GITHUB-integration, with issue access and more. Use GH-MCP

## Development Notes

### Database Schema Changes
This project uses breaking database schema changes between versions. Always run `backend/db_migration.py` when upgrading and backup the database first using the provided script.

### Docker Development
The application is designed to run in Docker with mounted volumes for data persistence and secrets management.

### Logging
Application uses rotating file logs configured in `uvicorn_log_config.ini`, logs stored in `/data/logs/` when running in Docker.

## Agent System

### Overview
This project uses a specialized agent system to coordinate development work. Each agent has specific responsibilities and communicates via `issues.md` as the central coordination hub.

### Available Agents
Agents are defined in `.claude/agents/` directory:

1. **architect** (`.claude/agents/architect.md`)
   - Role: System design, technical decisions, feature planning
   - MCP Access: IDE diagnostics
   - Output: Architecture plans and task breakdowns in issues.md

2. **ux-designer** (`.claude/agents/ux-designer.md`)
   - Role: User experience design, UI patterns, user workflows
   - MCP Access: Playwright (browser automation)
   - Output: UX designs and interface specifications in issues.md

3. **full-stack-developer** (`.claude/agents/full-stack-developer.md`)
   - Role: Implementation across database, backend, and frontend
   - MCP Access: IDE diagnostics, Playwright
   - Output: Working code with implementation notes in issues.md

4. **qa-reviewer** (`.claude/agents/qa-reviewer.md`)
   - Role: Code review, quality assurance, test protocol creation
   - MCP Access: IDE diagnostics, Playwright
   - Output: Test protocols, QA reviews, and bug reports in issues.md

5. **documentation-specialist** (`.claude/agents/documentation-specialist.md`)
   - Role: Documentation maintenance (CLAUDE.md, issues.md, README.md, test protocols)
   - MCP Access: None (file operations only)
   - Output: Updated documentation files

### Agent Workflows

#### Feature Development Workflow
Standard workflow for implementing new features:

1. **architect**: Plan feature architecture
   - Read CLAUDE.md and issues.md for context
   - Create architecture plan with task breakdown
   - Document technical decisions and approach
   - Add plan to issues.md
   - Handoff to: **ux-designer**

2. **ux-designer**: Design user experience
   - Review architecture plan
   - Design UI components (pages, modals, forms)

### Communication Protocol

#### issues.md as Central Hub
All agents communicate through `issues.md`:
- Architecture plans
- UX designs
- Implementation progress
- QA reviews and test results
- Documentation updates

#### Handoff Format
Each agent should clearly indicate handoff:
```markdown
### Handoff
Ready for: **[agent-name]**
```

#### Status Tracking
Use these status indicators in issues.md:
- **Planning**: architect working
- **Design**: ux-designer working
- **In Progress**: full-stack-developer working
- **Review**: qa-reviewer working
- **Documentation**: documentation-specialist working
- **Complete**: All work done

### Agent Invocation

To invoke an agent during a Claude Code session, you can reference them by name or request their specific expertise. For example:
- "Can the architect help plan this feature?"
- "Let's have the ux-designer design the UI for this"
- "Have the qa-reviewer check this code"

Agents will follow their defined roles and responsibilities as documented in their respective files in `.claude/agents/`.

### Benefits of Agent System
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Each agent focuses on their expertise
- **Consistent quality**: Structured reviews and testing for all features
- **Better planning**: Upfront design before implementation
- **Comprehensive testing**: Dedicated QA process
- **Maintained documentation**: Dedicated doc updates
- **Traceable workflow**: All work documented in issues.md
