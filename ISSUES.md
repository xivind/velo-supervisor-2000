# ISSUES CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS
This file (ISSUES.md) must be read on startup. This file contains information on what we are currently working on. Claude Code should ensure that this file is up to date, as the work progress.

**Current Status**: Collections feature has significant gaps in implementation. Core modal and API endpoints exist, but key functionality is missing. Working on completing Phase 2-6 before Phase 7 cleanup.  

# Component Collections Feature Specification

## Problem Statement

Users currently need to change status individually for each component when working with logical groupings (e.g., a wheel consists of tube, hub, and rim). The current process is cumbersome when users want to retire, uninstall, or change status for multiple related components simultaneously.

**Example Use Case:** When changing a wheel, users currently must:
1. Change status for tube (e.g., to "Retired")
2. Change status for hub (e.g., to "Retired") 
3. Change status for rim (e.g., to "Retired")

**Desired Outcome:** Users should be able to create a "Front Wheel" collection containing tube, hub, and rim, then change status for the entire collection in one operation.

## Solution Overview

Implement a **Component Collections** system that allows users to:
- Create named collections of related components
- Perform bulk status changes on entire collections
- Manage collections through intuitive UI integrated into existing pages
- Maintain full compatibility with existing individual component workflows

## Database Design

### Collections Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE collections (
    collection_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE,
    collection_name TEXT,
    comment TEXT,
    updated_date TEXT,
    bike_id TEXT,  -- Optional (NULL allowed for template collections)
    components TEXT,  -- JSON string of component IDs
    sub_collections TEXT  -- JSON string of collection IDs (future use, populate as "[]")
)
```

**Rationale:** Single table design follows existing patterns from `Workplans` and `Incidents` tables that use JSON strings for component references.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Integration Strategy**
- **No new dedicated pages** - integrate into existing component overview and bike details pages
- **Reuse existing patterns** - leverage current modal system, JSON handling, and validation frameworks
- **Table-based display** - add collections tables to existing pages where contextually appropriate

### 2. **Component-Collection Relationship**
- **One collection per component** - enforced at business logic level
- **Individual component changes remain possible** - collections don't lock components
- **Collection membership is flexible** - components can be added/removed from collections

### 3. **Status Management**
- **Bulk status changes** - entire collection can change status simultaneously
- **Status consistency validation** - all components in collection must have same status for bulk operations
- **Individual overrides allowed** - single components can still be changed independently

## Business Rules

### Collection Management Rules
1. **Unique component membership**: Each component can only belong to one collection
2. **Flexible bike assignment**: Collections can exist without being assigned to a bike (templates)
3. **Non-destructive deletion**: Deleting a collection leaves components untouched

### Status Change Rules
1. **Collection status consistency**: All components within a collection must have identical status for bulk operations
2. **Mixed status blocking**: Bulk status changes are blocked if collection contains components with different statuses
3. **Individual component flexibility**: Components can be changed individually even when part of collections
4. **Persistent warnings**: Users receive clear, persistent warnings about mixed statuses that prevent bulk operations

### Validation Strategy
1. **Dual validation**: Frontend modal validation + backend business logic enforcement
2. **Clear user feedback**: Toast notifications for errors, persistent modal warnings for mixed statuses
3. **Graceful degradation**: Mixed status collections show warnings but remain functional for individual component operations
4. **Frontend validation**: Collection name validation handled in JavaScript modal (empty name prevention)
5. **Backend validation**: Focus on data integrity (component existence, unique membership)
6. **Bike assignment rule**: Collections with installed components must be assigned to a bike (validate in both frontend and backend)

## UI/UX Design

### Page Integration
1. **Component Overview Page**: 
   - Show all collections in dedicated table
   - Allow creation/management of collections
   - Display collection icons next to components

2. **Bike Details Page**: 
   - Show bike-specific collections in dedicated table
   - Same functionality as overview page but filtered by bike

3. **Component Details Page**: 
   - Show "Edit Collection" button (since component can only be in one collection)
   - No collections table needed

### Collections Table Columns
- Collection Name
- Component Count
- Bike (if assigned)
- Last Updated  
- Actions (Edit/Delete buttons)

### Collection Modal Functionality
- **Create/Edit collections**: Name, description, bike assignment
- **Component selection**: Reuse existing component selection UI (similar to workplans/incidents)
- **Status change operations**: Bulk status change with validation
- **Persistent warnings**: Show mixed status warnings directly in modal
- **Frontend validation**: Prevent submission of invalid operations

### Visual Indicators
- **Component tables**: Show icon next to components that are part of collections
- **Consistent iconography**: Use clear, intuitive icons throughout the interface

**Status**: Core functionality partially implemented. Several key features missing before cleanup phase can begin.

## Recent Updates - Collections Modal Date Field Consolidation ✅

Successfully consolidated to single `updated_date` field throughout the entire system:
- ✅ Removed duplicate `collection_updated_date` hidden field
- ✅ Renamed `status_change_date` to `updated_date` in modal, JavaScript, and backend
- ✅ Updated templates to consistently use `updated_date` instead of `last_updated`
- ✅ Made field conditional - required only for status changes, optional for collection CRUD
- ✅ Field now properly tracks last status change date, not general collection updates

### Completed Tasks for Collections Modal:
1. ✅ **UI Enhancement**: Current status indicator with icons (⚡💤⛔) displayed below "New Status" field
2. ✅ **Content Review**: Reviewed and improved field titles and supporting texts for clarity and consistency
3. ✅ **UI Cleanup**: Optimized spacing, removed redundant elements, cleaner visual hierarchy
4. ✅ **Field Name Alignment**: Fixed all field name mismatches between modal, API, business logic, and database model
5. ✅ **TomSelect Integration**: Fixed dropdown initialization and behavior to match incidents/workplans pattern
6. ✅ **Component Filtering**: Added filtering of retired components from dropdown selection
7. ✅ **Computed Bike Assignment**: Implemented automatic bike field computation based on selected components
8. ✅ **Advanced Business Rules**: Added validation preventing mixed installation statuses and mixed bike assignments
9. ✅ **Smart Status Dropdown**: Dynamic dropdown that excludes current status and adapts to validation state
10. ✅ **Integrated Validation System**: Unified frontend and backend validation with clear error messaging
11. ✅ **Enhanced User Experience**: Real-time status computation with "Unable to compute" states for invalid selections

### Recently Completed - Major Collections Feature Enhancements:
- ✅ **Backend validation integration**: Both `add_collection` and `update_collection` now call enhanced validation methods
- ✅ **Business rule enforcement**: Cannot mix installed/not-installed components or components from different bikes
- ✅ **Dynamic UI feedback**: "Unable to compute bike" and "Unable to compute status" messaging for invalid selections
- ✅ **Streamlined interface**: Removed redundant status displays, optimized modal spacing
- ✅ **Context-aware controls**: Status dropdown shows only valid transitions, disabled for invalid states

### Collections Feature Ready for Production Testing

## Outstanding Collections Tasks:
1. 🔲 **Add "Last updated" indicator**: Add last updated timestamp and corresponding logic under the Updated date field
2. 🔲 **Retirement status handling**: Explore what happens when user tries to change status to "Retired", since retired components are filtered out from the component selection dropdown

## Critical Missing Functionality:

### Component Details Page Integration
- Component details page references `#editCollectionModal` which doesn't exist
- No collections table or management functionality on component details page
- Missing API endpoint to get collection data for a specific component

### Collection Deletion
- Delete buttons exist in tables but no JavaScript handlers
- No `/delete_collection` API endpoint
- No business logic method for collection deletion

### Error Handling and Validation
- JavaScript functions lack proper error handling
- Missing validation for edge cases in collection management

### Phase 8: Advanced Features (Future)
1. Collection templates and duplication
2. Nested collections (using `sub_collections` field)
3. Collection-based reporting and analytics

## Technical Considerations

### Existing Code Reuse
- **JSON handling**: Use existing `parse_json_string()` and component ID processing
- **Modal system**: Follow existing modal patterns from workplans/incidents
- **Validation framework**: Leverage existing dual frontend/backend validation
- **Toast notifications**: Use existing user feedback system

### Performance Considerations
- **JSON field indexing**: Consider indexing strategies for component lookups
- **Bulk operations**: Ensure efficient processing of multiple component status changes
- **UI responsiveness**: Handle large collections gracefully in modal interfaces

### Future Extensibility
- **Sub-collections field**: Database ready for nested collection functionality
- **Additional metadata**: Schema allows easy addition of new collection properties
- **API compatibility**: Design endpoints to support future mobile or API integrations

## Success Criteria

1. **User Experience**: Users can change status for multiple related components in single operation
2. **Data Integrity**: All existing component validation rules remain enforced
3. **System Integration**: Collections integrate seamlessly with existing workflows
4. **Performance**: No degradation in existing component management operations
5. **Flexibility**: System supports both collection-based and individual component workflows

## Non-Goals (Current Phase)

- **Nested collections**: Implemented later if needed using `sub_collections` field
- **Collection templates**: Advanced feature for future consideration  
- **Automated collection suggestions**: AI/ML-based collection recommendations
- **Collection sharing**: Cross-user or cross-system collection sharing
