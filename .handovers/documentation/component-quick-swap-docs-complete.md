## Commit Message

**Ready to use - copy/paste below:**

```
Add component quick swap feature

Streamline component replacement workflow by enabling users to swap
installed components in a single modal interaction, reducing what was
previously a 4-6 step process across multiple pages.

Key features:
- Swap to existing "Not installed" component OR create new with copied settings
- Component type matching strictly enforced (cannot swap brake pads with saddle)
- Health warnings when selecting components near end of life or needing service
- Accessible from Component Overview, Bike Details, and Component Details pages
- Modal-only feedback pattern with comprehensive validation
- Atomic operation creates two history records with synchronized timestamps

Implementation highlights:
- Backend: Quick swap orchestrator coordinates existing methods (create_component, create_history_record)
- Frontend: Progressive disclosure UI with TomSelect dropdowns and dynamic type filtering
- Follows Collections pattern for user feedback (loading modal â†’ report modal)
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting partial failures
- No new dependencies added

Files changed:
Backend (2 modified):
- backend/business_logic.py (added lines 1473-1611: orchestrator + validation)
- backend/main.py (added lines 265-302: /quick_swap endpoint)

Frontend (4 modified, 1 created):
- frontend/templates/modal_quick_swap.html (NEW - 144 lines)
- frontend/templates/component_overview.html (added quick swap button)
- frontend/templates/bike_details.html (added quick swap button)
- frontend/templates/component_details.html (added quick swap button)
- frontend/static/js/main.js (added lines 2158-2516: complete JS implementation)

Total: 680 lines added (177 backend, 503 frontend)

Code review: APPROVED WITH MINOR ISSUES (2 minor enhancements suggested, not blocking)
Governing principles compliance: 100% - exemplary code reuse and separation of concerns
Manual testing: Comprehensive across all access points and scenarios

## Documentation Assessment

### CLAUDE.md - No Updates Required

**Assessment:** No changes needed to `/home/xivind/code/velo-supervisor-2000/CLAUDE.md`

**Reasoning:**
- CLAUDE.md documents architecture, development workflow, and agent communication patterns
- Component Quick Swap is a feature addition, not a change to architecture or processes
- The feature follows existing patterns (no new architectural patterns introduced)
- No new development commands or configuration requirements
- No changes to agent workflows or handover processes
- TomSelect usage already documented in "Code Style & Standards" section (line 265-268)
- Feature will be documented in user-facing materials when appropriate

**Sections Reviewed:**
- âœ“ Project Overview - no changes needed (feature addition)
- âœ“ Architecture Overview - no changes needed (follows existing layered architecture)
- âœ“ Key Features - could add to list, but not critical (feature is self-explanatory from UI)
- âœ“ Development Commands - no changes needed
- âœ“ Code Style & Standards - no changes needed (TomSelect already documented)
- âœ“ Agent workflows - no changes needed

### README.md - No Updates Required

**Assessment:** No changes needed to `/home/xivind/code/velo-supervisor-2000/README.md`

**Reasoning:**
- README.md is user-facing documentation focused on setup, installation, and changelog
- Component Quick Swap is a UI feature discoverable through the interface (â™» buttons)
- Feature requires no additional setup or configuration from users
- Feature will be documented in v0.4.5 (or next release) in the "Future releases" section when human performs release
- No breaking changes or migration requirements
- No new dependencies or installation steps

**Sections Reviewed:**
- âœ“ Setup and configuration - no changes needed (no new config required)
- âœ“ Versioning and branches - no changes needed
- âœ“ Changelog - will be updated by human during release process (not now)

**Note:** The README.md changelog should be updated when human prepares the next release. Suggested changelog entry:

```markdown
**Planned for v0.4.5**

- Component Quick Swap: Streamlined workflow for replacing installed components in single modal interaction
- ... (other v0.4.5 features)
```

## Code Quality Summary (from Code Review)

### Overall Assessment
**Status:** APPROVED WITH MINOR ISSUES
**Quality Rating:** EXCELLENT

### Compliance Ratings
- **Governing Principles Compliance:** 100% (perfect adherence)
- **Code Reuse:** EXCELLENT (exemplary use of existing methods)
- **Separation of Concerns:** EXCELLENT (proper layered architecture)
- **User Feedback Pattern:** EXCELLENT (perfect modal-only pattern, NO toast notifications)
- **Security:** NO VULNERABILITIES FOUND
- **Accessibility:** COMPLIANT (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Minor Issues Found
1. **Minor Issue #1:** Defensive coding suggestion for offset parameter (use `.get()` method)
   - Severity: Low - Not a bug, enhancement suggestion
   - Priority: Optional improvement

2. **Minor Issue #2:** Partial failure logging could include more context
   - Severity: Low - Current logging adequate, enhancement suggestion
   - Priority: Optional improvement

### Enhancement Opportunity
1. **Enhancement #1:** Consider implementing smart fate default (per UX spec)
   - Current: Always defaults to "Not installed"
   - UX Spec: Default to "Retired" if component reached end of life
   - Decision: Acceptable simplification, can enhance later if user feedback suggests it

### Deviations from Specifications
1. **Deviation 1:** Simplified fate selection default (always "Not installed")
   - Status: ACCEPTABLE - Reviewer approved
   - Impact: Low - user can easily override

2. **Deviation 2:** Old component dropdown without TomSelect (uses native select)
   - Status: ACCEPTABLE - Reviewer approved
   - Impact: Low - typically few installed components, native select sufficient

**Both deviations documented, justified, and approved by code reviewer.**

## Testing Summary

### Manual Testing Completed
- âœ“ All 3 access points tested (Component Overview, Bike Details, Component Details)
- âœ“ Both swap scenarios tested (swap to existing, create new)
- âœ“ Validation tested (client-side and server-side)
- âœ“ Component type filtering tested
- âœ“ User feedback flow tested (modal-only, NO toast notifications)
- âœ“ History records verified
- âœ“ Component status updates verified
- âœ“ TomSelect behavior tested (initialization, cleanup, memory leak prevention)
- âœ“ Progressive disclosure tested
- âœ“ Health warnings tested
- âœ“ Responsive design tested (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- âœ“ Edge cases tested

### Browser Testing
- âœ“ Chrome (latest) - Linux
- âœ“ Firefox (latest) - Linux
- âœ— Safari (latest) - Not tested (macOS not available)
- âœ— Edge (latest) - Not tested (Windows not available)

**Note:** Safari and Edge testing recommended before production deployment (if those browsers are supported).

### Test Protocols
**Action Required (FUTURE):** Update test protocols in `tests/` directory to include quick swap scenarios.

**Recommended test cases:**
1. Component lifecycle testing - add quick swap scenario
2. Bike component management - add quick swap scenario
3. Component distance tracking - verify distances after swap
4. Edge cases - no available components, type mismatch, partial failures
