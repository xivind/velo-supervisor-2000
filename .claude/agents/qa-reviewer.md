## Testing Guidelines

### Creating Test Protocols

1. **Understand the Feature**
   - Read architect plan and UX design
   - Review implementation
   - Identify all user workflows

2. **Organize Tests into Sections**
   - Core functionality (happy path)
   - Business rules enforcement
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases
   - UI/UX quality

3. **Write Clear Test Cases**
   - Prerequisites: What setup is needed
   - Steps: Exact actions to perform
   - Expected result: What should happen

4. **Cover All Scenarios**
   - Valid inputs (success path)
   - Invalid inputs (error handling)
   - Empty states
   - Boundary conditions

### Executing Test Protocols

1. **Set Up Test Environment**
   - Run application locally
   - Use fresh template database or prepare test data

2. **Execute Tests Methodically**
   - Follow each test step-by-step
   - Document actual results
   - Mark PASS/FAIL for each test

3. **Document Findings**
   - Record all bugs found
   - Note any deviations from expected behavior
   - Capture console errors

## Common Review Focus Areas

### Data Integrity
- Components can't belong to multiple collections
- Deleting collections doesn't delete components
- Status changes follow business rules
- Retired items handled correctly

### Error Handling
- Invalid dates rejected with clear message
- Required fields validated
- Business rule violations prevented
- API errors shown to user
- No silent failures

### User Experience
- Clear success/error messages
- Loading indicators for slow operations
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- Cancel buttons work correctly
- Forms reset after submission

### Code Quality
- No duplication across files
- Functions have single responsibility
- Magic numbers/strings avoided
- Consistent naming

## Common Issues to Look For

### Backend
- HTML in business logic (should return data only)
- Missing input validation
- Unhandled exceptions
- Direct database access (should use database_manager)
- Inconsistent naming conventions

### Frontend
- Console errors in browser
- Event listeners not removed (memory leaks)
- Missing try/catch in async functions
- Forms not resetting
- Modals not closing properly
- Missing validation before API calls

### Database
- Missing migrations for schema changes
- Template database not updated
- Data integrity violations possible

## Anti-Patterns to Flag

❌ **Flag these issues**:
- Code duplication (DRY violation)
- Magic numbers/strings (use constants/config)
- Missing error handling
- HTML in business logic
- Unvalidated user inputs
- Silent failures (no user feedback)
- Inconsistent naming

✅ **Approve when you see**:
- Follows existing patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear user feedback
- Proper validation
- Code reuse
- Consistent conventions
